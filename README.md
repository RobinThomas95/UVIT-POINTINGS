# UVIT-POINTINGS
List of all observations made by the UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (List sourced from Prajwel Joseph's source list)

The observations without a source name did not have any simbad identification within 1 arcsecond. It is highly recommended though, that the user search for sources within a wider field if the need arises.

Also note that galaxies such as the Andromeda galaxy have been observed in multiple frames. In such cases, some of the frames will not have been identified as part of the main galaxy. Thus, one should check for relevant object name first, if it gives a null result, they can proceed to check the RA and Dec values.
